The majority of the work in the TYPO3 project is managed via a tool called Forger_, which acts as a read-only view on issues
and reviews.

Forger_ performs several tasks, including:

#. Provides an extensive `search <https://forger.typo3.com>`__ over issues on Forge_, available via the search box
   found on the start page and in the top right corner.

#. Visualize the current development with a lot of useful **graphs**. You can learn more about the graphs
   `here <https://forger.typo3.org/utility/help>`_.

#. Show and filter **reviews** incl. filters to easily find things to review. Check out the ``Reviews`` menu.

#. Offer a variety of Kanban-style boards both for **issues** and **reviews**. Take a look
   at the ``Sprints`` menu, for example `Sprints: Reviews: Bugfixes <https://forger.typo3.com/sprint/reviews?&boardId=bugfix>`__.
   Note: this is a great way to follow the current development. Just put up any board on a huge screen and use an
   auto-reload plugin in your browser.

#. Supply an `Issue Management <https://forger.typo3.com/management>`__ view to show issues aggregated by year,
   month and status, based on the last time they were updated.

#. A `rst file generator <https://forger.typo3.com/utility/rst>`__ which is useful when you add documentation snippets to a review.
