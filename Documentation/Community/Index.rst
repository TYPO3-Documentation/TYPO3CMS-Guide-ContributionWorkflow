the case, there are several possibilities to get help. Do not hesitate
to ask others, if you can't find the information you need.

Slack
=====

The main communication platform for TYPO3 is the Slack chat system. In
order to register for Slack, you **first need a typo3.org account**
and **then request a Slack account**. This is explained here: :ref:`slack-account`.

You can ask specific questions about contributing in the **#typo3-cms-coredev**
channel, general TYPO3 questions should be asked in the **#typo3-cms** channel.

For more information on Slack, see :ref:`Slack in the Appendix <appendix-slack-intro>`.

Events
======

Coding is great, but coding with others may be even better.
There is a wide variety of TYPO3 events where you can meet people, gain
knowledge and have fun doing it. Some of these events are especially
suited for core contributors, though you will probably benefit from
any TYPO3 event in some way or another.

* For a general overview of TYPO3 events, read the blogpost:
  `What You Gain by Taking Part in TYPO3 Events <https://typo3.com/blog/what-you-gain-by-taking-part-in-typo3-events/>`__
* For an up-to-date list of events, see `Events on typo3.org
  <https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__

Look for events like "Review Friday", "Code Sprints" and "Developer Days".
Next, we will describe some events that are relevant for core
contribution. They are not specifically targeted at providing support,
but the event may be open to new core contributors and may give
you the opportunity to ask questions and get help. In any case,
read the event description and if in doubt, contact the person
listed in the event description.
