What are merge conflicts?
=========================

Usually, git does a good job of merging several changes in one file.

However, there are occasions where git does not know what to do, because
one change *conflicts* with another, meaning there are more than one
possible way to merge.

This is actually a good thing.

In case of a merge conflict you will usually have these possibilities:

#. Use change 1

#. Use change 2

#. Use a combination which you manually combine.



Example
-------


Original file:

.. code-block:: none

   111
   222


Change 1

.. code-block:: none

   111
   aaa
   222

Change 2

.. code-block:: none

  111
  bbb
  222


Git cannot resolve this automatically, because it is ambiguous. What should
the result be?

Result 1

.. code-block:: none

  111
  aaa
  bbb
  222


Result 2

.. code-block:: none

  111
  bbb
  aaa
  222


The merge conflict markers (in the file) will show:

.. code-block:: none

   111
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   bbb
   =======
   aaa
   >>>>>>> aaa
   222


.. _how-to-see-merge-conflicts:

How to see merge conflicts in Gerrit or Forger
==============================================

If your patch has merge conflicts. Gerrit as well as Forger will
show you:

**Gerrit:** Load your patch page in the browser.

.. image:: /Images/External/Gerrit/HandlingAPatch/gerrit_merge_conflict.png
   :class: with-shadow


**Forger:** Open one of the `ReviewSprint <https://forger.typo3.com/sprint/reviews>`__
views on Forger.

.. image:: /Images/External/Forger/forger_merge_conflicts.png
   :class: with-shadow

In that case, you will need to resolve the conflicts in
some way.

See next section :ref:`how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts` for more information about
resolving merge conflicts.

How to resolve conflicts?
=========================

Some git commands will show you that there are conflicts e.g. `git cherry-pick`,
`git rebase`, `git pull --rebase` etc. It will have inserted markers in the
files and ask you to resolve them and then continue.

You must resolve the conflict for all these files. There are several ways to do this.

Most editors or IDEs assist you in doing this. Check the information for your IDE.

Resolving the conflict, involves a 3-step process:

#. Identify files with conflicts: the git commands usually show which files
   have conflicts, also your Editor or IDE should show you (PhpStorm does).
#. Resolve the conflicts
#. Resume: Depending on the command that was executed (e.g. rebase,
   merge, cherry-pick), you will usually need to add the files and
   call something like `rebase --continue` or `cherry-pick --continue`

Identify files with conflicts
-----------------------------

The command (e.g. git rebase) usually tells you which files have conflicts,
e.g. git rebase gives us the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in typo3/sysext/install/Classes/Updates/ExtensionManagerTables.php

Identify files with conflicts (cherry-pick)
-------------------------------------------

Unfortunately `git cherry-pick` is a little stubborn and does not
show you which files are concerned:

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   $ git cherry-pick d48c3626d828de880342
   $ > error: could not apply d48c362... bbb
   $ > hint: after resolving the conflicts, mark the corrected paths
   $ > hint: with 'git add <paths>' or 'git rm <paths>'
   $ > hint: and commit the result with 'git commit'

However, git status will show you:

.. code-block:: none
   :linenos:

   $ git status
   $ > On branch main
   $ > You are currently cherry-picking commit 805a207.
   $ > (fix conflicts and run "git cherry-pick --continue")
   $ > (use "git cherry-pick --abort" to cancel the cherry-pick operation)
   $ >
   $ > Unmerged paths:
   $ >  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
   $ >
   $ >  both modified:   file_with_conflicts.txt
   $ >
   $ > no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

All files shown with "both modified" will need to be attended to.


Resolve the conflicts
---------------------

If you want to do it manually, look for all occurrences of `<<<<<<<`.

These are markers. They are used as follows (as in example above):

The merge conflict will show:

.. code-block:: none

   111
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   bbb
   =======
   aaa
   >>>>>>> aaa
   222

#. Beginning of conflict: `<<<<<<<`, after that name of branch for version 1 (here: HEAD)

#. Separation: `=======` Marks end of version1 and beginning of version2

#. End of conflict: `>>>>>>` and then name of branch version 2.


There may be more than one conflict in a file!


Resume command
--------------

When you are done, add the file and then continue:

.. code-block:: bash

   git add <path1>
   git add <path2>

In most cases, git will have told you what to do when it showed the conflict.

Resume git rebase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. code-block:: bash

   git rebase --continue


Resume git cherry-pick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   git cherry-pick --continue
