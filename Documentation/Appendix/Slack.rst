Slack
=====

If you wish to contribute, joining the
`TYPO3 slack workspace <https://typo3.slack.com>`__ is recommended as
it is the projects chosen platform for communication. In order to join
the slack workspace, you must already have your
`typo3.org <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=2>`__ account and then
`Register for TYPO3's Slack Platform <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__.

On that page, you will also find information about recommended channels.

Slack channels
--------------

*  **#typo3-cms-coredev** is your channel of choice for core development
*  **#typo3-cms** is for general support issues
*  **#random** if you are not sure which channel to use or have a general question


You do not need to ask for permission when asking a question. Ask your question directly
in the channel and wait for a response.


As always, make sure to follow the `Code of conduct <https://typo3.org/community/code-of-conduct/>`__
or the short form: **be nice, be helpful!**
