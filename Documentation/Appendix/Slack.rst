Slack
=====

If you wish to contribute, joining the
`TYPO3 slack workspace <https://typo3.slack.com>`__ is recommended as
it is the projects chosen platform for communication. In order to join
the slack workspace, you must already have your
`typo3.org <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=2>`__ account and then
`Register for TYPO3's Slack Platform <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__.

On that page, you will also find information about recommended channels.

Slack channels
--------------

* **#typo3-cms-coredev** is your channel of choice for core development
* **#typo3-cms** is for general support issues
* **#random** if you are not sure which channel to use or have a general question


You do not need to ask for permission when asking a question. Ask your question directly
in the channel and wait for a response.


As always, make sure to follow the `Code of conduct <https://typo3.org/community/code-of-conduct/>`__
or the short form: **be nice, be helpful!**

Botty on Slack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also checkout the help page on `"Botty" <https://wiki.typo3.org/T3Bot>`__, the TYPO3 slack bot. We will show you
some of its commands later in this manual.

You cannot use Botty in your private channel or in a direct messaging channel with someone else. Botty will
only be available in a public channel, to which it has been invited (which is the case in #typo3-cms-coredev).
