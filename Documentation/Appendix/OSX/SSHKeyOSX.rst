================================
Creating a SSH Public Key on OSX
================================

You generate an SSH key through Mac OS X by using the Terminal application. Once you upload a valid public SSH key,
Gerrit_ can authenticate you based on this key.

.. sidebar:: Finding the Terminal App

   The terminal provides you with a text-based command line interface to the Unix shell of Mac OS X.

   To open the Mac OS X Terminal, follow these steps:

   In Finder, choose Utilities from the Go menu.
   Find the Terminal application in the Utilities window.
   Double-click the Terminal application.
   The Terminal window opens with the command line prompt displaying the name of your machine and your username.

An SSH key consists of a pair of files. One is the private key, which you should **never** give to anyone. No one will ever
ask you for it and if so, simply ignore them - they are trying to steal it.
The other is the public key. When you generate your keys, you will use ``ssh-keygen`` to store the keys in a safe location
so you can authenticate with Gerrit_.

To generate SSH keys in Mac OS X, follow these steps:

#. Enter the following command in the Terminal window::

      ssh-keygen -t ed25519

   This starts the key generation process. When you execute this command, the ssh-keygen utility prompts you to indicate where to store the key.

#. Press the ``ENTER`` key to accept the default location. The ssh-keygen utility prompts you for a passphrase.

#. Type in a passphrase. You can also hit the ``ENTER`` key to accept the default (no passphrase). However, this is not recommended.

.. warning::

   You will need to enter the passphrase a second time to continue.

After you confirm the passphrase, the system generates the key pair and you will see output like this:

.. code-block:: text

   Your identification has been saved in /Users/yourmacusername/.ssh/id_ed25519.
   Your public key has been saved in /Users/yourmacusername/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   ae:89:72:0b:85:da:5a:f4:7c:1f:c2:43:fd:c6:44:38 yourmacusername@yourmac.local
   The key's randomart image is:
   +--[ RSA 2048]----+
   |                 |
   |         .       |
   |        E .      |
   |   .   . o       |
   |  o . . S .      |
   | + + o . +       |
   |. + o = o +      |
   | o...o * o       |
   |.  oo.o .        |
   +-----------------+

Your private key is saved to the ``id_rsa`` file in the ``.ssh`` subdirectory of your home directory and is used to verify
the public key you use belongs to your Gerrit_ account.

.. warning::

   Never share your private key with anyone! Ever! **We mean it!**

Your public key is saved to a file called ``id_rsa.pub`` in the ``.ssh`` subdirectory of your home directory. You can copy
it to your clipboard using the following command::

   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Now you can head over to Gerrit_, go to settings and paste your public key as described :ref:`here<GerritAccount>`.

Gerrit is using the special port `29418` instead of the default SSH port `22` which has to be configured accordingly. This can be done in your local `~/.ssh/config` file which would contain the following sections then::

   Host review.typo3.org
      Port 29418

Testing your connection::

      ssh -T <YOUR_TYPO3_USERNAME>@review.typo3.org
