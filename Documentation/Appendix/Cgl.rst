Coding Guidelines
=================

More information is found in the :ref:`Coding Guidelines <t3coreapi:cgl>`
section of the "TYPO3 Explained" manual (formerly known as "Core API").

This is just a very brief overview.


PHP
===

Make sure you are using the correct PHP codestyle. It is **PSR-1 / PSR-2** at
the time of writing and specified in the :ref:`TYPO3 Coding Guidelines
<t3coreapi:cgl>`.

See :ref:`PhpStorm setup: CGL <phpstorm-setup-cgl>` for information on how
to configure the correct coding style.

The Appendix contains information on scripts to check / fix coding
guideline issues: :ref:`cgl-fix-my-commit`

Xliff files
===========

Language files are usually stored in a Folder Resources/Private/Language
in files with the ending *.xlf*. While no tabs are allowed to indent
in PHP files, you should edit Xliff files using tabs.
