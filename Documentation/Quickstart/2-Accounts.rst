============================



..  rst-class:: bignums-xxl

1.  My TYPO3 (`https://my.typo3.org`__)

    Vital account! Acts as a Single Sign On (SSO) provider for
    several other services. See :ref:`TYPO3Account`.

2.  Gerrit (`https://review.typo3.org`__)

    The code review system that is used for your code contributions.
    There, all patches are commented and voted/approved/rejected.

    You login here via the `My TYPO3` SSO account and need to upload
    your SSH public key here. See :ref:`GerritAccount`.

3.  Forge (`https://forge.typo3.org/`__)

    The issue tracking platform (Redmine) where bugs and feature
    requests are reported. Every patch in Gerrit needs to have
    a corresponding issue.

    You login here via the `My TYPO3` SSO account.

4.  Slack (`https://typo3.slack.com/`__)

    The chat platform where developers get in touch with each other.
    The channel `#typo3-cms-coredev` is important.

    You need to register an account for Slack, see `https://typo3.org/community/meet/chat-slack/`__
    and :ref:`slack-account`.
