How to get help
===============

This guide attempts to provide all information necessary to contribute
to the TYPO3 codebase. However, you might run into problems. If this is
the case, there are several possibilities to get help. Do not hesitate
to ask others, if you can't find the information you need.

Slack
=====

The main communication platform for TYPO3 is the Slack chat system. In
order to register for Slack, you **first need a typo3.org account**
and **then request a Slack account**. This is explained here: :ref:`slack-account`.

(You will need the typo3.org account anyway, if you want to upload a patch
or write a bug report.)

You can ask specific questions about contributing in the **#typo3-cms-coredev**
channel, general TYPO3 questions should be asked in the **#typo3-cms** channel.

For more information on Slack, see :ref:`Slack in the Appendix <appendix-slack-intro>`.

Events
======

Coding is great, but coding with others may be even better.

There is a wide variety of TYPO3 events where you can meet people, gain
knowledge and have fun doing it. Some of these events are especially
suited for core contributors, though you will probably benefit from
any TYPO3 event in some way or another.

For a general overview of TYPO3 events, read the blogpost:
`What You Gain by Taking Part in TYPO3 Events <https://typo3.com/blog/what-you-gain-by-taking-part-in-typo3-events/>`__

For an up-to-date list of events, see `Events on typo3.org
<https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__

Look for events like "Review Friday", "Code Sprints" and "Developer Days".

Next, we will describe some events that are relevant for core
contribution. They are not specifically targeted at providing support,
but the event may be open to new core contributors and may give
you the opportunity to ask questions and get help. In any case,
read the event description and if in doubt, contact the person
listed in the event description.

TYPO3 GmbH Review Friday
------------------------

If you live near Düsseldorf in Germany, Review Friday might be your event of choice.

During this event, you can work on your patch(es) and communicate with other

Code Sprints
------------

For joining code sprints, it is recommended that you have at least a little experience
with TYPO3 core contribution and are familiar with the workflow.

Look for the next code sprints on the `Events page on typo3.org
<https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__.

In the event description you should also find information about reimbursement and other
information. You will usually need to signup for the event.

TYPO3 Developer Days
--------------------

The developer days usually take place once a year. It is a great way to connect
with other TYPO3 developers. If the "Coding Nights" take place during the Developer Days, it
is a very good opportunity to code for TYPO3 with others.

You will also find the next Developer Days on the `Events page on typo3.org
<https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__.
