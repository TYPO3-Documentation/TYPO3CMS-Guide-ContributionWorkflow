Prerequisites and Useful Tools
==============================

Required:

*  Git
*  Docker and Docker Composer for running :file:`runTests.sh` to setup, build,
   perform checks and run tests. Alternatively, you can run some of the tools
   locally or within DDEV. In that case, they must also be installed.

Recommended:

*  IDE with TYPO3 plugins, such as PhpStorm or Visual Studio Code. While you
   can also use a simple editor, a properly setup IDE will help with
   code-completion, marking errors and applying coding guidelines.
*  DDEV for setting up the TYPO3 installation. Alternative methods
   are possible, e.g. using a locally installed web server and database. DDEV
   provides custom configurations for TYPO3 which can be used for core
   development as well.

Information on using these tools is covered in detail later on this chapter.
