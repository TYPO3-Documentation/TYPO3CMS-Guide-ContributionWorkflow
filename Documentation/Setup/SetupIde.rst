Coding Guidelines
-----------------

There is an .editorconfig file in the TYPO3 core repository.
See http://EditorConfig.org for more information.

Please note that the rules in :file:`.editorconfig` are very minimal. So, additionally,
setup your Editor / IDE to use PSR-1 / PSR-2 for PHP files, and use the other
standards as described in the :ref:`Coding Guidelines of TYPO3 <t3coreapi:cgl>`.

See :ref:`PhpStorm setup CGL <phpstorm-setup-cgl>` for information about setting up
PhpStorm to comply with the Coding Guidelines.
