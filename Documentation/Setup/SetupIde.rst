Coding Guidelines
-----------------

There is an :file:`.editorconfig` file in the TYPO3 core repository.
See https://editorconfig.org/ for more information.

Please note that the rules in :file:`.editorconfig` are very minimal. So, additionally,
setup your editor / IDE to use the recommendation as described in the
:ref:`Coding Guidelines of TYPO3 <t3coreapi:cgl>`.

See :ref:`PhpStorm setup CGL <phpstorm-setup-cgl>` for information about setting up
PhpStorm to comply with the Coding Guidelines.
