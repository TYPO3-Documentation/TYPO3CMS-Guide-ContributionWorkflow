=========
Git Setup
=========

.. note::

   If you are working on a previously cloned, older repository, the TYPO3
   repository URL changed to GitHub **and the branch "master" changed to "main".**
   Existing repositories can be adapted like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ git remote set-url origin git://github.com/typo3/typo3
      $ git config remote.origin.pushurl "ssh://<your-username>@review.typo3.org:29418/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git"
      $ git config remote.origin.push +refs/heads/main:refs/for/main

   See `Renaming the TYPO3 GitHub Repository <https://typo3.org/article/renaming-the-typo3-github-repository>`__.

These steps will walk you through your basic Git setup when working with TYPO3.

Prerequisites
=============

* If you want to get an introduction to how our workflow works, :ref:`head over here<workflow-explained>`
* We expect you have a fully-fledged web development setup at hand. If you are not sure, though, :ref:`take a look here <prerequisites>`.
* Make sure, you have cloned the TYPO3 source as described previously in :ref:`setup-typo3-git-clone`::

      git clone git@github.com:typo3/typo3 .

.. _set-username-and-email:

Set Username and Email
======================

*-- required* (unless this is already setup globally, see `git config --global -l`)

You need to instruct git to work with your name and email address. Make sure the email address and user name are the same as those you used when
:ref:`setting up your TYPO3 account<TYPO3Account>`::

   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your-email@example.org"

.. _set-autosetuprebase:

Set autosetuprebase
===================

*-- required*

In order to avoid weird merges in your local repository when pulling in new commits from typo3.org, we encourage everybody
to set the autosetuprebase option, such that your local commits are always rebased on top of the official code::

   git config branch.autosetuprebase remote

Install Your Commit Hooks
=========================

There are two git hooks available for TYPO3 development:

* :ref:`commit-msg-hook`: required
* :ref:`pre-commit-hook`: optional, currently not available for Windows

To set them up, do the following:

commit-msg Hook
---------------

*-- required*

Activate the hook by copying the sample file to :file:`.git/hooks/commit-msg`::

   # ensure folder exists
   mkdir -p .git/hooks

   # copy
   cp Build/git-hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg

   # make executable
   chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg

.. note::

   You usually do not need the `mkdir` or the `chmod`. It does not do any harm to
   execute it in any case though.

More information: :ref:`commit-msg-hook`


pre-commit Hook
---------------

*-- optional*

The pre-commit hook runs on Linux and MacOS. To use the pre-commit hook on Windows you can use a tool like the `Git BASH <https://gitforwindows.org/>`__.

Activate the hook by copying the sample file to :file:`.git/hooks/pre-commit`::

   # ensure folder exists
   mkdir -p .git/hooks

   # copy
   cp Build/git-hooks/unix+mac/pre-commit .git/hooks/

   # make executable
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

More information: :ref:`pre-commit-hook`


Alternative: Setup With Composer
--------------------------------

As an alternative for copying the hook scripts manually, you can use the following composer command:

For Linux / MacOS::

   composer gerrit:setup

This will "install" the :file:`commit-msg` hook and :file:`pre-commit` hook.

More information: :ref:`custom-composer-commands`.



.. index::
   single: Code Contribution Workflow; git setup remote

.. _git-setup-remote:

Setting up Your Remote
======================

*-- required*

You must instruct Git to push to Gerrit_ instead of the original repository. It acts as a kind of facade in front of Git::

   git config remote.origin.pushurl ssh://<YOUR_TYPO3_USERNAME>@review.typo3.org:29418/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git


This will instruct Git to push using the
`refs/for namespace <https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/concept-refs-for-namespace.html>`__
when you do `git push`::

   git config remote.origin.push +refs/heads/main:refs/for/main


.. index::
   single: Code Contribution Workflow; Commit Message Template
   single: Git Setup; Commit Message Template

.. _committemplate:

Setting up a Commit Message Template
====================================

*-- optional*

If you follow these instructions, whenever you create a new commit,
Git will use the template to create the commit message, which you can
then modify in your editor. So use this, to make it easier for you to
fill out the required information.

First, create a file, for example in :file:`~/.gitmessage.txt`.

.. code-block:: none

   [BUGFIX|TASK|FEATURE]

   Resolves: #
   Releases: main, 10.4

Make Git use this file as a template for the commit message::

   git config commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt


For additional information about how to write a proper commit message
see :ref:`commitmessage`.


.. _git-show-config:

Show Configuration
==================

*-- optional*

Show current configuration::

  git config -l

The result should look like this::

   ...
   remote.origin.url=git@github.com:typo3/typo3
   remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
   branch.main.remote=origin
   branch.main.merge=refs/heads/main
   branch.autosetuprebase=remote
   url.ssh://<YOUR_TYPO3_USERNAME>@review.typo3.org:29418/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git
   commit.template=/path/to/.gitmessage.txt
   ...

Or, compare the :file:`.git/config` file inside the repository::

    [core]
       repositoryformatversion = 0
       filemode = true
       bare = false
       logallrefupdates = true
    [remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:typo3/typo3
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        pushurl = ssh://<TYPO3_USER_NAME>@review.typo3.org:29418/Packages/TYPO3.CMS.git
    [branch "main"]
       remote = origin
       merge = refs/heads/main
    [branch]
       autosetuprebase = remote
    [commit]
       template = /path/to/.gitmessage.txt
