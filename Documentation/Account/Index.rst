Setting up Your Accounts
========================

These are the TYPO3 online tools you will be using. For these you need a typo3.org account.

* **Forge**: our **Issue Tracker** based on Redmine
* **Gerrit**: our **Code Review** System
* **Slack**:  which is used for general communication
  (not required, but strongly recommended)

Follow the instructions to setup your accounts:
