Username
   Pick a username you like. The form will directly tell you whether it's available or not.
   To save yourself from annoying problems later on down the road, to not use special
   characters like `@` or `!` in your username. Just use alphanumeric characters.

E-mail
   Your email address should be the one you want to be using for notification emails from Forge_ and Gerrit_. Also
   think twice whether your company email is appropriate here.

Full Name
   Please use your real name here. It isn't really fun discussing with l33troXXor92.

Password
   Choose a strong password here. Ideally, use a password manager to create a really strong password.

Repeat
   Enter your (really strong) password here.

.. note::

   Once you have registered you will receive an email from the system to verify your account - basic stuff.
